          <h1 class="card-title mt-3 mb-3">Bio / Backstory</h1>
          <h2 class="card-text ">Udran was hanging out in the domain of the god of rock (the type of music, not the stone) playing on his guitar, when the Rock God waltzed up to him.</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">“Hey dude, so like, me and the boys are planning something like a battle of the bands, 'n we saw you rockin’ out over here and wanted to know if you wanted in. There will be a prize for the first-place winner, but you’re not like, obligated or anything to participate.”</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">“Are you kidding me!? I was zapped into existence to rock! There is no way that I'd give up a chance like this! I’m also interested in the prize, but that is definitely NOT why I’m joining!”</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">Udran played many songs and absolutely dominated everyone who played against him, except for this one dude who was using jingle bells, that was a close battle. The Rock God once again walked up to Udran and made an announcement in front of everyone.</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">“Hey man, that was pretty cool, but like, the dude you were supposed to face off against forgot he had work today, so like, I’m the only person you can battle against.”</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">Without any warning the Rock God suddenly started to jam out, leaving Udran no time to start playing.</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">“LET’S GO, I’M THE WINNER! Ahem, yeah, I think that about settles it. So, like, I won this session, so I get the prize. Also, you are banished for a while for losing, so that’s a thing. Good luck.”</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">Without any time to play himself or debate his exile, Udran was thrust out of the heavens into the world below. He held no disdain towards the Rock God, for the chords that the Rock God played were the most powerful thing he had ever heard. Udran decided that he would enhance his musical abilities so that one day he might once again have a chance to jam out with the Rock God.</h2>
          <h1 class="card-title mt-4">Details / Extras</h1>
          <h2 class="card-text">- Founder of this borderline mental group</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text">- Likes to perform, even when it's not the right situation for a performance</h2>
