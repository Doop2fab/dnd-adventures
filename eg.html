          <h2 class="card-text">Once born a regular-ass bird, Eg was extremely charismatic and cool, even for birds.
            Everyone likes each other when you're a bird so he wasn't like a rock star or anything like that but rest
            assured he was all the good things you want to be and a bird. One day when he was flying along somewhere in
            the sky he got hit with an anthropomorphization beam and became a bird-person, instantaneously forcing into
            existence a bizarre race of people who are birds with a name quickly generated by the extremely fast stream
            of sounds and letters that flooded Eg's brain as it expanded to accommodate two extra limbs and some other
            stuff, a name which will not be replicated here for brevity. Regrettably, this name was quickly lost to time
            as all things are which are not written down, and so "Aarakocra" was settled for instead because of its
            similar bizarreness. At any rate, the resulting Aarakocra had no real place they existed in within the
            Material Plane and so the gods who were on shift that day frantically started choosing random locations to
            let the Aarakocra flow in from the Elemental Plane of Air, which exists as you can tell by its real-sounding
            name. Eg was already in a place when he became himself but the gods didn't recall placing him so they picked
            him up and placed him in a completely new area which he didn't recognize. Though many other Aarakocra were
            fortunate enough to have been placed in distances close enough to congregate in various bands, Eg was kind
            of just alone, which explains why he’s presently travelling with a bunch of sweaty weirdos who keep trying
            to kill themselves instead of chilling with some bangin hot hens or something.</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">Before that, though, he found his way to a village, where he was quickly taken in
            by the local lord as an oddity to deliver to the king in order to patch up a particularly regrettable faux
            pas a fortnight or so back. The lord didn’t feel especially fulfilled after having sent the strange
            birdperson off, but was glad to not have to deal with that weirdness anymore regardless.</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">As hindsight now informs us, Aarakocra freak the veritable fuck out when they’re
            confined, and so Eg’s short stint as a strange addition to the king’s throne room was quickly ended as the
            reality of the situation became apparent. A person-sized animal without the capacity to be trained against
            its naturally casually-defecative habits has the propensity to generate a mindboggling amount of liquid
            shit. The king, head aching from the inhuman squalling beating against his hungover skullmeat, ordered the
            birdthing to be released and “please oh gods do something useful just shut the hell up,” thus starting Eg’s
            quest to find something justifying his existence.</h2>

          <h2 class="card-text">- Will eat a worm if you dare him to</h2>
