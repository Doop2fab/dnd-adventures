          <h1 class="card-title mt-4">Bio / Backstory</h1>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">Grangrim was born to two parents and belongs to the Xaldri Clan, a rather small
            group of gnomes known for their strange affinity for beasts, especially pigs, and their ongoing war with the
            Blightpods, a colony of grub-like monsters infamous for their ability to ravage an entire civilization
            within days leaving no trace of organic life behind. For Grangrim’s 4th birthday, his father Wargrim
            gave him a bow fashioned out of the springiest branches in Xanth, as it is custom for young Xaldri children
            to receive a weapon of their parent’s choosing on their 4th year of life. Five days after Grangrim’s
            birthday, the Xaldri were attacked by the Blightpod Queen and thousands of her Devourers, losing almost 90%
            of their population in the process. Wargrim stayed behind to fight with the Royal Battalion while his mother
            fled with Grangrim in her arms far away from the village, protecting him along the way and taking shelter in
            the neighboring gnomish settlement. Eventually, news spread that Xaldri had fought off the Blightpods but
            suffered heavy losses. Frantically, Ipa traveled back home with Grangrim to see if Wargrim had survived the
            bloodbath. Upon their arrival, medics from the Royal Battalion broke the news to Ipa and her young son –
            Wargrim had given his life to save his many crewmates from certain death and allowed them to successfully
            stave off the Blightpod Queen. The only remnant left of Wargrim, however, was the tall hat he had always
            worn around the village. Ipa gave Grangrim that hat as a keepsake and a constant reminder of his brave
            father. From that day on, Grangrim’s only goal in life was to become part of the Royal Battalion. He
            practiced with his father’s gift for years on end until it broke, eventually becoming the Royal Battalion’s
            best and earning himself the rank “Loser”. In Xaldri culture, the title “Loser” means exactly the opposite
            of its common definition, reserved for only those who possess fantastic skill and finesse. Grangrim fit
            that title perfectly.</h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">In 20 years, Grangrim had become the ideal soldier in Royal Battalion, and he was
            taken care of very well. Even the generals and commanders tended to ask his opinion on battle tactics,
            defense plans, and hunting sessions. It is safe to say, I think, that Grangrim lived a very carefree and
            lavish life - but to a fault. As Grangrim was preoccupied with the ongoings of the Royal Battalion, his
            mother was aging terribly and becoming increasingly frail. One day, Ipa was attacked by bandits and maimed
            so terribly the medics could not save her. Everything Grangrim had taken for granted - his lifestyle, his
            mother’s life, his family - had changed. Grangrim swore to never take the life of a fellow friend or family
            member for granted ever again, cursing his enemies and growing a blind hatred for them. Anyone or anything
            that threatened him or someone he cared about was as good as dead.
          </h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">In the next year, Grangrim eventually left the Royal Battalion, wishing to find the
            Blightpod Queen and slay her. After all, everything he had known was contained within a 5-mile radius from
            Xaldri, and taking care of the Blightpods once and for all was the best thing he could do for those he loved
            and cared about. A message brought by a Neverwinter Guard caught his attention, and thinking this was a
            great opportunity to meet great warriors while searching for the Blightpod Queen, he set out for the kingdom
            with his father’s old hat.
