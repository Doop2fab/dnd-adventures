          <h1 class="card-title mt-4">Bio / Backstory</h1>
          <h2 class="card-text">The daughter and only child of Ilkar and Linnetia Stormwind, Mara has been immersed in
            the expectations and scheming of nobility since birth. Mara became well-known in the villages surrounding
            Stormwind Manor and Estates for her charm and smooth tongue during her childhood, but in her late teenage
            years, she has also been blessed with stunning natural beauty rivaled by few in the land. Mara didn’t often
            leave her estates, but when she did travel to anywhere where she was known, she was the talk of the town.

          </h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">When Mara was five years old, her father, who was still trying to pretend that he had a
            son, tried to train Mara in swordsmanship and archery. Mara's obvious lack of ability never deterred her
            father, but one day Mara became so frustrated that she threw her sword all the way out of her sight—without
            ever touching the sword. Mara's father ran away from her in fear and shunned her for nearly nine years.
            Mara's mother, when she learned about the situation and that Mara had read the ancient scroll in the library
            that had a spell on it, brought in a personal tutor to begin teaching Mara the basics of magic. Meanwhile,
            during those nine years, Mara's mother ingrained in Mara a sense of compassion and respect for goodness.
          </h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">During her teenage years, Mara's father, apparently having come to terms with Mara being
            his heir, began instructing her in the most important duties of being a noble from House Stormwind, such as
            how to maintain the service staff, how to associate with and create new allies in the courts, and how to
            inspire followers among all classes of people. During these years, Mara became inspired to find a platform
            from which to share and implement her vision for the world as Queen Over All the Realms. </h2>
          <h2 class="card-text mt-4">Shortly after her nineteenth birthday, Mara received word that the King of Neverwinter
            was recruiting adventurers in order to find a magical icosahedron. Hoping that gaining fame through
            adventuring might provide her the platform she desired, Mara set out for Neverwinter, ready to unite the
            world under her rule.</h2>
